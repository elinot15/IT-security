WHEN MR HIRAM B OTIS THE AMERICAN MINISTER BOUGHT CANTERVILLE CHASE EVERY ONE TOLD HIM HE WAS DOING A VERY FOOLISH THING AS THERE WAS NO DOUBT AT ALL THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED INDEED LORD CANTERVILLE HIMSELF WHO WAS A MAN OF THE MOST PUNCTILIOUS HONOUR HAD FELT IT HIS DUTY TO MENTION THE FACT TO MR OTIS WHEN THEY CAME TO DISCUSS TERMS WE HAVE NOT CARED TO LIVE IN THE PLACE OURSELVES SAID LORD CANTERVILLE SINCE MY GRANDAUNT THE DOWAGER DUCHESS OF BOLTON WAS FRIGHTENED INTO A FIT FROM WHICH SHE NEVER REALLY RECOVERED BY TWO SKELETON HANDS BEING PLACED ON HER SHOULDERS AS SHE WAS DRESSING FOR DINNER AND I FEEL BOUND TO TELL YOU MR OTIS THAT THE GHOST HAS BEEN SEEN BY SEVERAL LIVING MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY AS WELL AS BY THE RECTOR OF THE PARISH THE REV AUGUSTUS DAMPIER WHO IS A FELLOW OF KINGS COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE AFTER THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT TO THE DUCHESS NONE OF OUR YOUNGER SERVANTS WOULD STAY WITH US AND LADY CANTERVILLE OFTEN GOT VERY LITTLE SLEEP AT NIGHT IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE MYSTERIOUS NOISES THAT CAME FROM THE CORRIDOR AND THE LIBRARY MY LORD ANSWERED THE MINISTER I WILL TAKE THE FURNITURE AND THE GHOST AT A VALUATION I HAVE COME FROM A MODERN COUNTRY WHERE WE HAVE EVERYTHING THAT MONEY CAN BUY AND WITH ALL OUR SPRY YOUNG FELLOWS PAINTING THE OLD WORLD RED AND CARRYING OFF YOUR BEST ACTORS AND PRIMADONNAS I RECKON THAT IF THERE WERE SUCH A THING AS A GHOST IN EUROPE WED HAVE IT AT HOME IN A VERY SHORT TIME IN ONE OF OUR PUBLIC MUSEUMS OR ON THE ROAD AS A SHOW I FEAR THAT THE GHOST EXISTS SAID LORD CANTERVILLE SMILING THOUGH IT MAY HAVE RESISTED THE OVERTURES OF YOUR ENTERPRISING IMPRESARIOS IT HAS BEEN WELL KNOWN FOR THREE CENTURIES SINCE 1584 IN FACT AND ALWAYS MAKES ITS APPEARANCE BEFORE THE DEATH OF ANY MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY WELL SO DOES THE FAMILY DOCTOR FOR THAT MATTER LORD CANTERVILLE BUT THERE IS NO SUCH THING SIR AS A GHOST AND I GUESS THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE NOT GOING TO BE SUSPENDED FOR THE BRITISH ARISTOCRACY YOU ARE CERTAINLY VERY NATURAL IN AMERICA ANSWERED LORD CANTERVILLE WHO DID NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND MR OTISS LAST OBSERVATION AND IF YOU DONT MIND A GHOST IN THE HOUSE IT IS ALL RIGHT ONLY YOU MUST REMEMBER I WARNED YOU A FEW WEEKS AFTER THIS THE PURCHASE WAS CONCLUDED AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE SEASON THE MINISTER AND HIS FAMILY WENT DOWN TO CANTERVILLE CHASE MRS OTIS WHO AS MISS LUCRETIA R TAPPAN OF WEST 53D STREET HAD BEEN A CELEBRATED NEW YORK BELLE WAS NOW A VERY HANDSOME MIDDLEAGED WOMAN WITH FINE EYES AND A SUPERB PROFILE MANY AMERICAN LADIES ON LEAVING THEIR NATIVE LAND ADOPT AN APPEARANCE OF CHRONIC ILLHEALTH UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT IT IS A FORM OF EUROPEAN REFINEMENT BUT MRS OTIS HAD NEVER FALLEN INTO THIS ERROR SHE HAD A MAGNIFICENT CONSTITUTION AND A REALLY WONDERFUL AMOUNT OF ANIMAL SPIRITS INDEED IN MANY RESPECTS SHE WAS QUITE ENGLISH AND WAS AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE REALLY EVERYTHING IN COMMON WITH AMERICA NOWADAYS EXCEPT OF COURSE LANGUAGE HER ELDEST SON CHRISTENED WASHINGTON BY HIS PARENTS IN A MOMENT OF PATRIOTISM WHICH HE NEVER CEASED TO REGRET WAS A FAIRHAIRED RATHER GOODLOOKING YOUNG MAN WHO HAD QUALIFIED HIMSELF FOR AMERICAN DIPLOMACY BY LEADING THE GERMAN AT THE NEWPORT CASINO FOR THREE SUCCESSIVE SEASONS AND EVEN IN LONDON WAS WELL KNOWN AS AN EXCELLENT DANCER GARDENIAS AND THE PEERAGE WERE HIS ONLY WEAKNESSES OTHERWISE HE WAS EXTREMELY SENSIBLE MISS VIRGINIA E OTIS WAS A LITTLE GIRL OF FIFTEEN LITHE AND LOVELY AS A FAWN AND WITH A FINE FREEDOM IN HER LARGE BLUE EYES SHE WAS A WONDERFUL AMAZON AND HAD ONCE RACED OLD LORD BILTON ON HER PONY TWICE ROUND THE PARK WINNING BY A LENGTH AND A HALF JUST IN FRONT OF THE ACHILLES STATUE TO THE HUGE DELIGHT OF THE YOUNG DUKE OF CHESHIRE WHO PROPOSED FOR HER ON THE SPOT AND WAS SENT BACK TO ETON THAT VERY NIGHT BY HIS GUARDIANS IN FLOODS OF TEARS AFTER VIRGINIA CAME THE TWINS WHO WERE USUALLY CALLED THE STAR AND STRIPES AS THEY WERE ALWAYS GETTING SWISHED THEY WERE DELIGHTFUL BOYS AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE WORTHY MINISTER THE ONLY TRUE REPUBLICANS OF THE FAMILY AS CANTERVILLE CHASE IS SEVEN MILES FROM ASCOT THE NEAREST RAILWAY STATION MR OTIS HAD TELEGRAPHED FOR A WAGGONETTE TO MEET THEM AND THEY STARTED ON THEIR DRIVE IN HIGH SPIRITS IT WAS A LOVELY JULY EVENING AND THE AIR WAS DELICATE WITH THE SCENT OF THE PINEWOODS NOW AND THEN THEY HEARD A WOODPIGEON BROODING OVER ITS OWN SWEET VOICE OR SAW DEEP IN THE RUSTLING FERN THE BURNISHED BREAST OF THE PHEASANT LITTLE SQUIRRELS PEERED AT THEM FROM THE BEECHTREES AS THEY WENT BY AND THE RABBITS SCUDDED AWAY THROUGH THE BRUSHWOOD AND OVER THE MOSSY KNOLLS WITH THEIR WHITE TAILS IN THE AIR AS THEY ENTERED THE AVENUE OF CANTERVILLE CHASE HOWEVER THE SKY BECAME SUDDENLY OVERCAST WITH CLOUDS A CURIOUS STILLNESS SEEMED TO HOLD THE ATMOSPHERE A GREAT FLIGHT OF ROOKS PASSED SILENTLY OVER THEIR HEADS AND BEFORE THEY REACHED THE HOUSE SOME BIG DROPS OF RAIN HAD FALLEN STANDING ON THE STEPS TO RECEIVE THEM WAS AN OLD WOMAN NEATLY DRESSED IN BLACK SILK WITH A WHITE CAP AND APRON THIS WAS MRS UMNEY THE HOUSEKEEPER WHOM MRS OTIS AT LADY CANTERVILLES EARNEST REQUEST HAD CONSENTED TO KEEP IN HER FORMER POSITION SHE MADE THEM EACH A LOW CURTSEY AS THEY ALIGHTED AND SAID IN A QUAINT OLDFASHIONED MANNER I BID YOU WELCOME TO CANTERVILLE CHASE FOLLOWING HER THEY PASSED THROUGH THE FINE TUDOR HALL INTO THE LIBRARY A LONG LOW ROOM PANELLED IN BLACK OAK AT THE END OF WHICH WAS A LARGE STAINED GLASS WINDOW HERE THEY FOUND TEA LAID OUT FOR THEM AND AFTER TAKING OFF THEIR WRAPS THEY SAT DOWN AND BEGAN TO LOOK ROUND WHILE MRS UMNEY WAITED ON THEM SUDDENLY MRS OTIS CAUGHT SIGHT OF A DULL RED STAIN ON THE FLOOR JUST BY THE FIREPLACE AND QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF WHAT IT REALLY SIGNIFIED SAID TO MRS UMNEY I AM AFRAID SOMETHING HAS BEEN SPILT THERE YES MADAM REPLIED THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER IN A LOW VOICE BLOOD HAS BEEN SPILT ON THAT SPOT HOW HORRID CRIED MRS OTIS I DONT AT ALL CARE FOR BLOODSTAINS IN A SITTINGROOM IT MUST BE REMOVED AT ONCE THE OLD WOMAN SMILED AND ANSWERED IN THE SAME LOW MYSTERIOUS VOICE IT IS THE BLOOD OF LADY ELEANORE DE CANTERVILLE WHO WAS MURDERED ON THAT VERY SPOT BY HER OWN HUSBAND SIR SIMON DE CANTERVILLE IN 1575 SIR SIMON SURVIVED HER NINE YEARS AND DISAPPEARED SUDDENLY UNDER VERY MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES HIS BODY HAS NEVER BEEN DISCOVERED BUT HIS GUILTY SPIRIT STILL HAUNTS THE CHASE THE BLOODSTAIN HAS BEEN MUCH ADMIRED BY TOURISTS AND OTHERS AND CANNOT BE REMOVED THAT IS ALL NONSENSE CRIED WASHINGTON OTIS PINKERTONS CHAMPION STAIN REMOVER AND PARAGON DETERGENT WILL CLEAN IT UP IN NO TIME AND BEFORE THE TERRIFIED HOUSEKEEPER COULD INTERFERE HE HAD FALLEN UPON HIS KNEES AND WAS RAPIDLY SCOURING THE FLOOR WITH A SMALL STICK OF WHAT LOOKED LIKE A BLACK COSMETIC IN A FEW MOMENTS NO TRACE OF THE BLOODSTAIN COULD BE SEEN I KNEW PINKERTON WOULD DO IT HE EXCLAIMED TRIUMPHANTLY AS HE LOOKED ROUND AT HIS ADMIRING FAMILY BUT NO SOONER HAD HE SAID THESE WORDS THAN A TERRIBLE FLASH OF LIGHTNING LIT UP THE SOMBRE ROOM A FEARFUL PEAL OF THUNDER MADE THEM ALL START TO THEIR FEET AND MRS UMNEY FAINTED WHAT A MONSTROUS CLIMATE SAID THE AMERICAN MINISTER CALMLY AS HE LIT A LONG CHEROOT I GUESS THE OLD COUNTRY IS SO OVERPOPULATED THAT THEY HAVE NOT ENOUGH DECENT WEATHER FOR EVERYBODY I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN OF OPINION THAT EMIGRATION IS THE ONLY THING FOR ENGLAND MY DEAR HIRAM CRIED MRS OTIS WHAT CAN WE DO WITH A WOMAN WHO FAINTS CHARGE IT TO HER LIKE BREAKAGES ANSWERED THE MINISTER SHE WONT FAINT AFTER THAT AND IN A FEW MOMENTS MRS UMNEY CERTAINLY CAME TO THERE WAS NO DOUBT HOWEVER THAT SHE WAS EXTREMELY UPSET AND SHE STERNLY WARNED MR OTIS TO BEWARE OF SOME TROUBLE COMING TO THE HOUSE I HAVE SEEN THINGS WITH MY OWN EYES SIR SHE SAID THAT WOULD MAKE ANY CHRISTIANS HAIR STAND ON END AND MANY AND MANY A NIGHT I HAVE NOT CLOSED MY EYES IN SLEEP FOR THE AWFUL THINGS THAT ARE DONE HERE MR OTIS HOWEVER AND HIS WIFE WARMLY ASSURED THE HONEST SOUL THAT THEY WERE NOT AFRAID OF GHOSTS AND AFTER INVOKING THE BLESSINGS OF PROVIDENCE ON HER NEW MASTER AND MISTRESS AND MAKING ARRANGEMENTS FOR AN INCREASE OF SALARY THE OLD HOUSEKEEPER TOTTERED OFF TO HER OWN ROOM THE STORM RAGED FIERCELY ALL THAT NIGHT BUT NOTHING OF PARTICULAR NOTE OCCURRED THE NEXT MORNING HOWEVER WHEN THEY CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST THEY FOUND THE TERRIBLE STAIN OF BLOOD ONCE AGAIN ON THE FLOOR I DONT THINK IT CAN BE THE FAULT OF THE PARAGON DETERGENT SAID WASHINGTON FOR I HAVE TRIED IT WITH EVERYTHING IT MUST BE THE GHOST HE ACCORDINGLY RUBBED OUT THE STAIN A SECOND TIME BUT THE SECOND MORNING IT APPEARED AGAIN THE THIRD MORNING ALSO IT WAS THERE THOUGH THE LIBRARY HAD BEEN LOCKED UP AT NIGHT BY MR OTIS HIMSELF AND THE KEY CARRIED UPSTAIRS THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE NOW QUITE INTERESTED MR OTIS BEGAN TO SUSPECT THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO DOGMATIC IN HIS DENIAL OF THE EXISTENCE OF GHOSTS MRS OTIS EXPRESSED HER INTENTION OF JOINING THE PSYCHICAL SOCIETY AND WASHINGTON PREPARED A LONG LETTER TO MESSRS MYERS AND PODMORE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PERMANENCE OF SANGUINEOUS STAINS WHEN CONNECTED WITH CRIME THAT NIGHT ALL DOUBTS ABOUT THE OBJECTIVE EXISTENCE OF PHANTASMATA WERE REMOVED FOR EVER THE DAY HAD BEEN WARM AND SUNNY AND IN THE COOL OF THE EVENING THE WHOLE FAMILY WENT OUT TO DRIVE THEY DID NOT RETURN HOME TILL NINE OCLOCK WHEN THEY HAD A LIGHT SUPPER THE CONVERSATION IN NO WAY TURNED UPON GHOSTS SO THERE WERE NOT EVEN THOSE PRIMARY CONDITIONS OF RECEPTIVE EXPECTATIONS WHICH SO OFTEN PRECEDE THE PRESENTATION OF PSYCHICAL PHENOMENA THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED AS I HAVE SINCE LEARNED FROM MR OTIS WERE MERELY SUCH AS FORM THE ORDINARY CONVERSATION OF CULTURED AMERICANS OF THE BETTER CLASS SUCH AS THE IMMENSE SUPERIORITY OF MISS FANNY DEVONPORT OVER SARAH BERNHARDT AS AN ACTRESS THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING GREEN CORN BUCKWHEAT CAKES AND HOMINY EVEN IN THE BEST ENGLISH HOUSES THE IMPORTANCE OF BOSTON IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLDSOUL THE ADVANTAGES OF THE BAGGAGECHECK SYSTEM IN RAILWAY TRAVELLING AND THE SWEETNESS OF THE NEW YORK ACCENT AS COMPARED TO THE LONDON DRAWL NO MENTION AT ALL WAS MADE OF THE SUPERNATURAL NOR WAS SIR SIMON DE CANTERVILLE ALLUDED TO IN ANY WAY AT ELEVEN OCLOCK THE FAMILY RETIRED AND BY HALFPAST ALL THE LIGHTS WERE OUT SOME TIME AFTER MR OTIS WAS AWAKENED BY A CURIOUS NOISE IN THE CORRIDOR OUTSIDE HIS ROOM IT SOUNDED LIKE THE CLANK OF METAL AND SEEMED TO BE COMING NEARER EVERY MOMENT HE GOT UP AT ONCE STRUCK A MATCH AND LOOKED AT THE TIME IT WAS EXACTLY ONE OCLOCK HE WAS QUITE CALM AND FELT HIS PULSE WHICH WAS NOT AT ALL FEVERISH THE STRANGE NOISE STILL CONTINUED AND WITH IT HE HEARD DISTINCTLY THE SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS HE PUT ON HIS SLIPPERS TOOK A SMALL OBLONG PHIAL OUT OF HIS DRESSINGCASE AND OPENED THE DOOR RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM HE SAW IN THE WAN MOONLIGHT AN OLD MAN OF TERRIBLE ASPECT HIS EYES WERE AS RED BURNING COALS LONG GREY HAIR FELL OVER HIS SHOULDERS IN MATTED COILS HIS GARMENTS WHICH WERE OF ANTIQUE CUT WERE SOILED AND RAGGED AND FROM HIS WRISTS AND ANKLES HUNG HEAVY MANACLES AND RUSTY GYVES MY DEAR SIR SAID MR OTIS I REALLY MUST INSIST ON YOUR OILING THOSE CHAINS AND HAVE BROUGHT YOU FOR THAT PURPOSE A SMALL BOTTLE OF THE TAMMANY RISING SUN LUBRICATOR IT IS SAID TO BE COMPLETELY EFFICACIOUS UPON ONE APPLICATION AND THERE ARE SEVERAL TESTIMONIALS TO THAT EFFECT ON THE WRAPPER FROM SOME OF OUR MOST EMINENT NATIVE DIVINES I SHALL LEAVE IT HERE FOR YOU BY THE BEDROOM CANDLES AND WILL BE HAPPY TO SUPPLY YOU WITH MORE SHOULD YOU REQUIRE IT WITH THESE WORDS THE UNITED STATES MINISTER LAID THE BOTTLE DOWN ON A MARBLE TABLE AND CLOSING HIS DOOR RETIRED TO REST FOR A MOMENT THE CANTERVILLE GHOST STOOD QUITE MOTIONLESS IN NATURAL INDIGNATION THEN DASHING THE BOTTLE VIOLENTLY UPON THE POLISHED FLOOR HE FLED DOWN THE CORRIDOR UTTERING HOLLOW GROANS AND EMITTING A GHASTLY GREEN LIGHT JUST HOWEVER AS HE REACHED THE TOP OF THE GREAT OAK STAIRCASE A DOOR WAS FLUNG OPEN TWO LITTLE WHITEROBED FIGURES APPEARED AND A LARGE PILLOW WHIZZED PAST HIS HEAD THERE WAS EVIDENTLY NO TIME TO BE LOST SO HASTILY ADOPTING THE FOURTH DIMENSION OF SPACE AS A MEANS OF ESCAPE HE VANISHED THROUGH THE WAINSCOTING AND THE HOUSE BECAME QUITE QUIET ON REACHING A SMALL SECRET CHAMBER IN THE LEFT WING HE LEANED UP AGAINST A MOONBEAM TO RECOVER HIS BREATH AND BEGAN TO TRY AND REALIZE HIS POSITION NEVER IN A BRILLIANT AND UNINTERRUPTED CAREER OF THREE HUNDRED YEARS HAD HE BEEN SO GROSSLY INSULTED HE THOUGHT OF THE DOWAGER DUCHESS WHOM HE HAD FRIGHTENED INTO A FIT AS SHE STOOD BEFORE THE GLASS IN HER LACE AND DIAMONDS OF THE FOUR HOUSEMAIDS WHO HAD GONE INTO HYSTERICS WHEN HE MERELY GRINNED AT THEM THROUGH THE CURTAINS ON ONE OF THE SPARE BEDROOMS OF THE RECTOR OF THE PARISH WHOSE CANDLE HE HAD BLOWN OUT AS HE WAS COMING LATE ONE NIGHT FROM THE LIBRARY AND WHO HAD BEEN UNDER THE CARE OF SIR WILLIAM GULL EVER SINCE A PERFECT MARTYR TO NERVOUS DISORDERS AND OF OLD MADAME DE TREMOUILLAC WHO HAVING WAKENED UP ONE MORNING EARLY AND SEEN A SKELETON SEATED IN AN ARMCHAIR BY THE FIRE READING HER DIARY HAD BEEN CONFINED TO HER BED FOR SIX WEEKS WITH AN ATTACK OF BRAIN FEVER AND ON HER RECOVERY HAD BECOME RECONCILED TO THE CHURCH AND BROKEN OFF HER CONNECTION WITH THAT NOTORIOUS SCEPTIC MONSIEUR DE VOLTAIRE HE REMEMBERED THE TERRIBLE NIGHT WHEN THE WICKED LORD CANTERVILLE WAS FOUND CHOKING IN HIS DRESSINGROOM WITH THE KNAVE OF DIAMONDS HALFWAY DOWN HIS THROAT AND CONFESSED JUST BEFORE HE DIED THAT HE HAD CHEATED CHARLES JAMES FOX OUT OF L50000 AT CROCKFORDS BY MEANS OF THAT VERY CARD AND SWORE THAT THE GHOST HAD MADE HIM SWALLOW IT ALL HIS GREAT ACHIEVEMENTS CAME BACK TO HIM AGAIN FROM THE BUTLER WHO HAD SHOT HIMSELF IN THE PANTRY BECAUSE HE HAD SEEN A GREEN HAND TAPPING AT THE WINDOWPANE TO THE BEAUTIFUL LADY STUTFIELD WHO WAS ALWAYS OBLIGED TO WEAR A BLACK VELVET BAND ROUND HER THROAT TO HIDE THE MARK OF FIVE FINGERS BURNT UPON HER WHITE SKIN AND WHO DROWNED HERSELF AT LAST IN THE CARPPOND AT THE END OF THE KINGS WALK WITH THE ENTHUSIASTIC EGOTISM OF THE TRUE ARTIST HE WENT OVER HIS MOST CELEBRATED PERFORMANCES AND SMILED BITTERLY TO HIMSELF AS HE RECALLED TO MIND HIS LAST APPEARANCE AS RED REUBEN OR THE STRANGLED BABE HIS _DEBUT_ AS GUANT GIBEON THE BLOODSUCKER OF BEXLEY MOOR AND THE _FURORE_ HE HAD EXCITED ONE LOVELY JUNE EVENING BY MERELY PLAYING NINEPINS WITH HIS OWN BONES UPON THE LAWNTENNIS GROUND AND AFTER ALL THIS SOME WRETCHED MODERN AMERICANS WERE TO COME AND OFFER HIM THE RISING SUN LUBRICATOR AND THROW PILLOWS AT HIS HEAD IT WAS QUITE UNBEARABLE BESIDES NO GHOST IN HISTORY HAD EVER BEEN TREATED IN THIS MANNER ACCORDINGLY HE DETERMINED TO HAVE VENGEANCE AND REMAINED TILL DAYLIGHT IN AN ATTITUDE OF DEEP THOUGHT
